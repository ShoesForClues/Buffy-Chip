A game I made in a single day.

# Why I Made This
It all started when I was living back in my college dorm. There were these two elevators in the west building and a touchscreen kiosk next to it. I was a freshman and during the first two weeks of the semester, I had to suffer from the constant breakdowns of the elevators. Almost everyday either 1 or both elevators would break down. This was a hassle because I lived on the 11th floor and waiting for the elevators always took approximately 5 minutes.

So one day, frustrated while waiting for the elevator, I looked at the kiosk and realized that hardly no one uses it. Probably one of the reasons why this university is so expensive is because they always spend it on unnecessary gimicks like these. I thought to myself, why not put a game on this for people to play as they wait for the elevator? It would at least give the kiosk a better purpose. Now of course the first step was to figure out how to run custom programs on the kiosk. As I was inspecting it, there were no other input devices besides the touchscreen itself. However, I noticed something as I tapped the screen. A side bar would show up and present a virtual keyboard GUI. Upon seeing that, I realized the kiosk was running Windows 7. I pressed the windows home button and voila, the entire desktop showed up. Such security for a university kiosk!

Anyways, the kiosk was hooked up to the internet via ethernet, however it did not have any web browsers. Without a web browser I am unable to download anything. However, that doesn't mean it's over. I recalled back when I was 12 years old, my dad deleted internet explorer from my account when I got grounded. Upon my desperate needs for the internet, I began inspecting other programs on the computer and noticed that the help GUI from Computer Manager had a URL textbox. Out of my curiosity, I typed in google and voila, google showed up! Besides the point, I tested this on the kiosk and it worked.

When the elevator finally arrived, I went back to my dorm room and began developing the game right away. I was eager to make this so I could benchmark my development speed and so I could impress other people in this building. Since I already had a game framework made (fusion), I decided to use that. I was still deciding what game I should make and ended with Flappy Bird because it would be the easiest. Now, I am not an artist so I could not make all of the assets. Instead I got most from google images and the only texture I created was a pixelated version of the university's mascot. It took me a few hours, and I finally finished near midnight.

When I was done, I uploaded the file to google drive in a ZIP content and noted the URL on my phone. Both my roommate and I then rushed down. It took a while to type the entire URL in the textbox, but it worked. The web page showed, and I pressed download and it started downloading! The last step was to unzip the file and I was hoping the kiosk had some sort of zip extractor, luckily it did. Apparently it had winrar installed, so I extracted the files into documents and ran the program. A few seconds later, the game showed up! A whole lot of other people began to see it and many have played it. I was happy.
